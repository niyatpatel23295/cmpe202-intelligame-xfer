IntelliGame is a web-based fun and interactive game that is currently under development at [Computer Engineering Department](https://cmpe.sjsu.edu/)  of [San Jose State University](http://www.sjsu.edu/). It is a team project for the graduate course "CMPE-202 Software Systems Engineering" instructed by [Paul Nguyen](https://github.com/paulnguyen/) during Fall 2017. 

IntelliGame is going to be developed within an 8-week plan. Two different agile methodologies are going to be practiced during this project: Kanban for the first half, and Scrum for the second half.
